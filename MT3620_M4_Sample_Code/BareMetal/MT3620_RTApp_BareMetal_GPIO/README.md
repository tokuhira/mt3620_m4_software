# Sample: MT3620 M4 real-time application - Bare Metal GPIO

### Description

This sample demonstrates how to use GPIO on an MT3620 real-time core.

- It provides access to one of the LEDs on the MT3620 development board using GPIO.
- It uses a button to change the blink rate of the LED.

It runs directly on one of the MT3620 real-time cores(M4) instead of the high-level core(A7).
Please refer to the [MT3620 M4 API Rerference Manual](https://support.mediatek.com/AzureSphere/mt3620/M4_API_Reference_Manual) for the detailed API description.
